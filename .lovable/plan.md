# WealthFlow — Premium Landing Page

A dark, premium fintech-style marketing website for your WealthFlow iOS app. Three pages: Home, Privacy Policy, and Support.

---

## 🎨 Design Direction
- **Dark premium theme** with deep navy/charcoal backgrounds, subtle gradients, and glowing blue accent highlights
- **Modern typography** using Inter or a similar premium sans-serif font
- **Smooth scroll-triggered animations** — elements fade in, slide up, and scale as users scroll
- **Glassmorphism cards** with frosted glass effects for feature highlights
- **Particle or gradient orb background effects** for that premium fintech feel
